Medical Billing Application (In Progress)

This software system will be a Medical Billing System (MBS) to be used by a local medical billing office. The MBS will be designed to submit, process and or reconcile claims made by users or patients. Alongside these actions the MBS will also process bills and payments as well as update user account balances and issue reports on request.

The software will be a web-based application to be utilized by the hospitalâ€™s billing team in conjunction with the pre-existing Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. The purpose of the software is to speed up the insurance adjudication process. This will increase a faster turnaround and a greater stream of revenue.
